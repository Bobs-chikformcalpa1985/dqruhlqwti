Just walked out of the theater after 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩𝘪𝘯𝘨 Phule. Wow, where do I even start? Have you ever tried to untangle a bunch of old Christmas lights, and somehow it's annoying but also kinda satisfying? Well, that's what my brain feels like right now. The  's buzzing around my skull like, you know, a fly in a dollhouse—totally out of place but somehow belonging there or something. 

First off, the opening scene...what even? It felt like someone was trying to fry an egg on a car hood while riding a unicycle. And dear lord, the color palette—purple everywhere, like Prince himself decided to paint the town. But hey, it kinda worked? In this strange, kaleidoscopic way. It's like they hired a whole kindergarten class to do the lighting.

The story, man. It's like trying to explain why you get out of bed in the morning. It's sort of there but also...not. The characters were these magnets of chaos, constantly pulling you in different directions but with that kind of rusty humor that makes you chuckle like you're not supposed to but you still do.

> Anyhow, the lead actor was pretty phenomenal. Like, I would've 𝘥𝘰𝘸𝘯𝘭𝘰𝘢𝘥ed the   just to 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩 him do anything really. Eat cereal. Rake leaves. He’s got this face you can't ignore, like a dog who just sneezed on you but instantly made you forget it.

Oh, and the music. My ears are still debating it. Sometimes it felt like they stole my brain playlist and turned it inside out. Thumping bass one moment, gentle violin the next. But it works, you know? It honestly works in a way maple syrup shouldn't pair with spaghetti, but we all know someone who'd argue it does.

Just before the credits rolled, there's this scene. I won't spoil it, but it's like pulling the last puzzle piece from under the couch. And realize it's not the right piece. But somehow, it completes the picture in a new, chaotic way. 

function experience𝘧𝘪𝘭𝘮(feelings) {
    if (feelings === confused) {
        return Welcome to Phule.;
    } else {
        return 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩 the  .;
    }
}

So yeah, after all this, I feel like I might need a nap. Or a stiff drink. Or maybe a new brain. Not sure if I'm recommending this   or warning you about it—or maybe both? Probably both. Go see it, don’t see it, whatever, right? Just know you’ll walk out of that theater a little differently than how you went in.
